Various of South Korean Go player Lee Sedol, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, and Google co-founder Sergey Brin entering news conference\r\n2. SOUNDBITE: (English) Sergey Brin, Google co-founder:\r\n\"It's really exciting to be here. I should tell you that I spent a lot of time during Grad school playing Go myself, in fact so much so that my co-founder Larry thought Google might never happen because I spent so much time playing Go. Fortunately I was not very good at it, and nothing like the gentleman we have here today.\"\r\n3. Cutaway\r\n4. SOUNDBITE: (English with Korean translation) Sergey Brin, Google co-founder:\r\n\"And when you watch really great Go players play, it is like a thing of beauty. So I am very excited that we have been able to instil that kind of beauty in our computers, in the art of the computer.\"\r\n5. Lee and Hassabis walking onto stage\r\n6. SOUNDBITE: (English) Demis Hassabis, Google DeepMind CEO:\r\n\"To be honest we are a bit stunned and speechless. Lee Sedol put up an incredible fight again. AlphaGo made a large territory at the bottom of the board, but Mr Lee found some really amazing tactics to play in the territory and create a really huge co-fight.\"\r\n7. Lee and Hassabis on stage\r\n8. SOUNDBITE: (English) Demis Hassabis, Google DeepMind CEO:\r\n\"I wanted to say about AlphaGo can compute tens of thousands of positions per second, but what's really incredible is that Lee Sedol can compete with that just with the power of his mind and ingenuity and stretched AlphaGo to its limit in the last three games.\"\r\n9. Lee and Hassabis on stage\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nGoogle's Go-playing software defeated a human champion for the third straight time on Saturday to clinch the best-of-five series and establish its superiority in an ancient Chinese game long thought to be the realm of humans.\r\nSouth Korea's Lee Sedol, one of the world's best Go players, remained without a win against AlphaGo, Google DeepMind's artificial intelligence machine, after another close match in Seoul. \r\nDespite losing the series, Lee is scheduled to play twice more against AlphaGo, on Sunday and Tuesday.\r\n===========================================================\r\nClients are reminded: \r\n(i) to check the terms of their licence agreements for use of content outside news programming and that further advice and assistance can be obtained from the AP Archive on: Tel +44 (0) 20 7482 7482 Email: info@aparchive.com\r\n(ii) they should check with the applicable collecting society in their Territory regarding the clearance of any sound recording or performance included within the AP Television News service \r\n(iii) they have editorial responsibility for the use of all and any content included within the AP Television News service and for libel, privacy, compliance and third party rights applicable to their Territory.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/eb77718186fc86b83866ac23e9d14dd7 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
