    "description": "(16 Jun 2016) Germany and Poland played out the first goalless draw of the European Championship on Thursday in a dour match at the Stade de France.\r\nA glaring miss was fittingly the key moment of a Group C game that led to Ukraine becoming the first team to be eliminated from Euro 2016.\r\nArkadiusz Milik, who scored Poland's winner against Northern Ireland on Sunday, miscued a header as he fell to his knees in Germany's goalmouth and the ball bounced just wide of Manuel Neuer's right-hand post.\r\nThat error, less than 20 seconds into the second half, hinted at better things after a lifeless first period.\r\nHowever, neither team could sustain any attacking pressure, and a point suits both after their opening wins. \r\nUkraine will finish last in the group after a pair of 2-0 losses, first to Germany then against Northern Ireland earlier Thursday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/b32439a624fb5a85025e07451e3fc1cc \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
